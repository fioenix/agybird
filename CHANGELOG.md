## Unreleased

## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-18

Verified against `agy` 1.4.2 with live headless runs on macOS: a read-only task, a denied command, an expired print timeout, and image generation.

- An expired `--timeout` is reported as `partial`, from agy's stderr notice or from the run lasting the full timeout. Since `agy` 1.1.28 the CLI answers it with exit 0 and a `SUCCESS` result, which the runner used to report as `success` with an empty or cut-off response. The runner now waits a grace period of 5 to 10 seconds past `--print-timeout` before killing `agy`, so that partial answer arrives.
- Image work through the `image-generator` subagent is recognised. Since `agy` 1.2.16 the main agent no longer calls `generate_image` itself, so every image run ended in `error`. The runner now accepts a completed `image-generator` subagent and takes its output from the subagent's transcript, which records each `generate_image` result; only those images, inside the brain directory of the run's conversation or its image subagent, count. The delegated prompt no longer asks for `generate_image` by name, and tells Antigravity not to copy or convert images with shell commands, which a headless run cannot approve.
- `denied_actions` on the terminal result now counts as a permission outcome. Each action reported only there appears in `permission_requests[]` without a target or a suggested rule, and the run is `blocked` instead of `success`.
- Exit code 3 is explained as an agent or model API failure mid-turn. The `AGY_ERROR` line stays out of the envelope with the rest of stderr.
- `--effort` accepts `xhigh` and `max`.
- `unsandboxed(...)` is no longer accepted by `--grant`; `agy` 1.2.2 deprecated it in favour of `command(...)`. When agy still asks for an `unsandboxed` grant, the runner suggests the matching `command(...)` rule.
- A conversation id from the stream is used as a brain directory only when it is a plain directory name.
- References updated for the `--json-schema` object-root requirement, the ask-first default for URL reads, plan-mode approval requests, and the retired default search tools.
- Agybird installs as a Codex plugin: `codex plugin marketplace add fioenix/agybird`, then `codex plugin add agybird@agybird`. `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` points Codex at a thin adapter in `.plugin-skills/agybird/`, which loads the root `SKILL.md`, because Codex does not discover a `SKILL.md` at the plugin root. The Claude Code plugin keeps loading the root skill directly. The Codex manifest sets `requires_local_executor`, since the runner starts a local `agy` process, so the Codex directory lists it as Desktop only.
- An icon and wordmark in light and dark variants: a round bird with a beak and an eye, three strokes of monoline SVG on a 128-unit grid in the same style and colours as Vietnamizer and Markmap Skills, with a 512 px `assets/icon.png`. Both plugin manifests and the README header use them. Both manifests and both marketplaces share one description and keyword set.
- `PRIVACY.md` says what reaches Google through `agy` and what Agybird keeps under `~/.agybird/`; `TERMS.md` covers the MIT terms and Google's terms for Antigravity. Both plugin manifests link them along with the support URL. The README gains a Data and network section saying what the runner starts, sends, and stores.
- Issue templates ask for `agy --version` and a redacted result envelope; a pull request template lists the checks a change needs.
- The release workflow checks that the tag matches `package.json` and both plugin manifests.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-08-23

- Verified full compatibility with official Antigravity CLI `agy` v1.1.19.
- Added background subagent hierarchy tracking: captures `subagent_info` from stream events and reports `subagents[]` (`type_name`, `role`, `conversation_id`, `log_uri`, `workspace_uris`) in the result envelope.
- Enhanced token and thinking observability: `usage` metrics now expose `thinking_tokens` (for reasoning models) and `cache_read_tokens` (for prompt caching) alongside standard token counts.
- Unified structured output extraction: `structured_output` is exposed at top-level envelope when `--json-schema` is enforced.
- Expanded native tool allow-rule mappings for `grep_search`, `find_by_name`, `read_url_content`, and `call_mcp_tool`.
- Added curated documentation hierarchy index in `references/docs.md` mapping core Antigravity architecture, headless IPC, permissions, sandbox, artifacts, and commands.
- Enhanced prompt orchestration guidelines in `references/code.md`, `references/general.md`, `references/image.md`, and `references/common.md`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-08-03

First release.

- An Agent Skill that delegates code, image, and general work to the official `agy` CLI, keeping authentication, permissions, sandbox, model access, and credits under the user's own Antigravity configuration.
- A dependency-free Node.js runner that emits one stable JSON envelope per invocation, with status `success`, `partial`, `needs_permission`, `blocked`, or `error`.
- One objective stays in one Antigravity conversation. The runner records the workspace's conversation and resumes it automatically, reported through `evidence.session_resumed`; `--new-session` begins a new objective deliberately.
- Denied actions are explained rather than reported as an opaque failure. `needs_permission` carries a `permission_requests[]` entry naming the tool, the target, and the allow-rule that would authorize it, taken from the `ask_permission` payload when agy names one itself. `target_truncated` says when the rule covers more than was rendered, and no rule is suggested for a target too long to review.
- `--grant` and `--grant-scope` apply a user-approved allow-rule to the session being resumed, written as a repository-scoped Antigravity project grant. A target must be an escaped literal, so no spelling of a wildcard is accepted. `once` is the default: the undo is journalled before the rule is applied, so a run that is killed is repaired by the next one and the repair is reported in `warnings[]`.
- A grant is held under a per-workspace lock, so a run on a different conversation cannot inherit one that is still live.
- Session state is one file per workspace under `~/.agybird/sessions/`, keyed on the canonical path so a symlinked directory or a differently-cased Windows drive letter does not lose the conversation.
- Image work requires a completed tool event and a real artifact inside the workspace or the matching provider artifact directory before reporting success.
- Never passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, never invents an allow-rule, and never runs a shell inside the runner.
- Zero runtime dependencies, tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows against Node.js 20 and 22.
- `docs/threat-model.md` documents the trust boundary and the residual risks; `docs/sdk-evaluation.md` records why the Antigravity Python SDK was not adopted as a runner backend.
